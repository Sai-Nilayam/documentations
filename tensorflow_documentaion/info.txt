This directory is dedicated to learn and document all of the learnings of 
tensorflow.

1. Why do we need to learn Tensorflow explicitly?
	Tensorflow provides simpler ways to use Complex Mathematical Algorithms. 
	But in order to implement a varaity of Algorithms we need to know how 
	exactly to impliment those using tensorflow. The only way to understand 
	this is by learning tensorflow basics from scratch.

2. What is the right way to code tensorflow?
	The right way to code tensorflow is by using a Jupyter Notebook. As 
	tensorflow is mostly used in Research oriented works.
