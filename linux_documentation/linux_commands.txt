1. Why do you need to learn Linux?
	Most of the Web Servers use Linux. So if we use Linux in our Local System
	then we already will have a good set of Linux Operating skill that will 
	help us to use Linux in Servers too.

2. What are the things you need to know while learning Linux?
	There is nothing specific. All you need to know how to do a specific thing
	that is needed for your goal. Once you learn it from any source write it 
	down in documentaion. Linux skills will gradually grow up with time. That 
	is the right way to learn different things in Linux.

5. What is all about SSH?
	SSH stands for Secure Shell. You need to generate two keys in your local
	machine called Private and Public keys. The Private key is gonna be stored in
	your Local Machine. And you need to update the Public key in your remote 
	machine.

	1. Generate a Key Pair - 'ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096''
	Pass Phrase: ssh_key (This is gonna be worked as the Password whenever you will
	try to use your Private key.)
	2. Go to the folder home/user-name/.ssh/ and Vim into the Public key. Copy it
	and update it to the Remote Machine. Apply proper Permissions. You are done.
	3. ssh into that Remote Machine - 'ssh user_name@ip_adress'

6. How to use a Well Featured Terminal in Linux?
	All you need to do is to edit some of the hidden files available in your 
	home folder namely '.bashrc' file and may be a few more to edit the way 
	your Terminal is working. In fact there are already pre-edited 
	configurations are available on internet. So all you need to do is to 
	download or clone a Repo and choose files that are necessary for you from 
	that Repo and copy paste them in your Home folder of your machine. Before 
	pasting these back up any of files with these name if pre-exist in your 
	Home directory to a folder 'dot_files'.

	Here's a set of practical example.
	Git Repository Link: https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles
	From the above Repos copy the files named .bashrc, .bash_profile, 
	.bash_prompt to your Home folder.
