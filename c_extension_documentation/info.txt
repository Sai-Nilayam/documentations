Here we are going to make a C Extension for Python and import it to Python and use it.
We are going to document all the steps included. 

Steps to use C files in Python
------------------------------
1. Install 'gcc' - A C Compiler.
2. Write a C file with '.c' extension and write some functions in it.
3. Make a Shared Object file using gcc from your '.c' file, by using -
gcc -shared test.c -o test_shared.out 
4. In the Python file import 'CDLL' from 'ctype' module.
5. Now do - cfile_test = CDLL(./'the C file name')
6. Now do - cfile_test.function_name(arguments) to use the functions those are 
written in the C file.

How to run a C file
-------------------
1. Write the C file.
2. Create an Object file using gcc - gcc test.c -o test.out.
3. Write in terminal, ./test.out and the file will run.
