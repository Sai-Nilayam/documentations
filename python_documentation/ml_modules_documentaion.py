"""Numpy
This section focused on different Linear Algebra operations and how to that
in Numpy in Python.

1. How to manually genrate a Matrix, Find it's shape, Reshape it, find its
   Transpose and Inverse.

2. How to genrate a Matrix with a proper shape with random numbers from
   Uniform Distribution, Normal Distribution etc and also of 0s, 1s and also
   Identity Matrix.

3. Concatenate two Matrix, Vertically and Horizontally.
   Note - In Numpy axis=0 means Vertical, axis=1 means Horizontal

4. Applying Inplace functionality along different axes. Fucntionality such as 
   min, max, sum, mean, median, mode(uses Scipy.stats).

5. Broadcasting in Numpy, with different Fucntionality. Fucntionality such as
   add, substract, multipy, devide or anyother. But how to apply different 
   fucntionality along different rows and columns. - Doubt

6. Calculating the Dot Product of two Matrix.

"""Pandas
This section focuses on all the details regarding Pandas library in Python.

1. What is the use of Pandas?
  Any operation that could be done in a Structured Dataset could be done 
  using Pandas.

2. Why to use Pandas over softwares like Microsoft Excel, Libre Office Calc or
any other Data Processing software?
  1. With any GUI based Data Analysis app (Spread Sheets) it is not possible 
  to separate the Logic and the Data Flow making the Data Analysis 
  difficult and also it is hard to debug any mistake.

  2. With Pandas you can automate a set of Data Processing operations so that
  a new given a new Dataset we could reuse our past efforts.

  3. Pandas is is more Flexible than that of any other GUI based available 
  app, because you are Programming with Pandas.

  4. Pandas is Faster than that of the availale softwares around 4000x.

  5. There are much more built-in functionality availabe in Pandas that you 
  can use quickly than that of any GUI based Spread Sheet app.

3. How would I learn Pandas?
  There's no need to learn Pandas from the beginning. Just do your projects 
  and serach for any fucntionality that you want during your project. That's 
  it. All the different fucntionality with Pandas are well available on 
  internet.

"""Matplotlib
This section focuses on the overview of Matplotlib library in Python.

1. Why to use Matplotlib?
    To plot different plots.

2. How would I learn Matplotlib?
    There's no need to explicitly learn Matplotlib. You could learn it while
    doing projects. The need is what are different types of Plots and what is
    their interpretation. You need to simple use Matplotlib for Plotting a 
    specific type of Plots.

3. What are different types of Plots?
    1. Scatter Plot
    2. Line Plot
    3. Bar Plot
    4. Pie Plot
    5. Histogram
    6. Heatmap
    7. Contour Plot
    8. Box and Whisker Plot
    9. Density Plot (Represent Distribution of a Variable)
    10. Word Cloud
    11. Map Plot

"""Scipy
This section focuses on what are different Mathematical Fucntions available in
Scipy library.

1. What can you do with Scipy?
   Any Advanced Mathematical Operatoions you have every come across in your 
   life you can apply it using Scipy.

2. Should I learn Scipy?
   No. You need to find for an Operation when you need it at Scipy Package. If 
   you are lucky you would find a pre-built code to implement that opearation.

3. When might you need to use Scipy?
   While writing codes for solving a complex mathematical problem, You often
   need some of the Complex Operations pre-build. In that case you might need 
   to use Scipy.

"""Scikit-Learn
This section focuses on the usage of Scikit-Learn.

1. Why we need to use Scikit-Learn?
   While doing any Traditional Machine Learning, all anything operation you 
   would do in general is pre-build in Scikit-Learn.

2. Do I need to explicitly learn Scikit-Learn?
   No. All you need to learn is different kind of Traditional Machine Leanring
   Algorithms and how to impliment them. When you need to impliment them, you 
   would expect someone would have written the core fundamenatal complex parts 
   and gives you the controls of the things you could do with the algorithm. 
   In that case you would import the Algorithm from the Scikit-Learn library 
   and use it.

   Here's a list of Algorithms you need to know as a basic base of Mahicne 
   Lerning.
      1. Supervised Learning Algorithms - Linear Regression, 
      Polynomial Regression, Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Tree based 
      Regressor and Classifier, Naive Bayes Classifier

      2. Unsupervised Learning Algorithms - K-Means, DB Clusting, Hierachical 
      Clustering, PCA, LDA.

Libraries.
1. What are different kind of Projects for Mahcine Lerning?
   Any kind of work that requries leaning could be a Mahcine Lenring project.
   Because Humans can learn they are able to do a lot of thigns. Here's the 
   summary what humans can do bacause they can learn. So if we could desing a 
   macine that can do the same thing, we did a machine larning.
