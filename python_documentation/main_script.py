"""This project covers the following concepts of Python.
1. Class

2. Instance Atrributes
3. Class Attributes

4. Regular Method
5. Class Method
6. Static Method

7. Inner Class

8. Inheritance
9. Sub Class
10. Super Class
11. Attribute Overriding
12. Method Overriding

13. Special Methods

14. Importing - if __name__ == '__main__':, __init__.py

# Important Notes
-----------------
1. Whenever a new Variable is defined in Python it replaces the old one. It 
will replace any Funciton name, Class name, Object name.

2. You can import a Module/Class/Function/Object. At the stage of a Module 
you could use the the dot '.' to access all of it's componets. Use the 'from'
key word to navigate to the container (It may be up to a neasted Folder or 
upto a Module.)

3. You need to know how to use dir() and help() funciton in Python effectively.

4. You need to understand any code that you see in anywhere.

5. We need to know all the Python's Key Words.

6. How Official Packageing works in Python? - Cleared Where is the limit at 
where the interpreter starts? - Doubt

7. How terms like Library, Package, module, script fits in a hierachy?
Library -> Package -> Module -> Script. The usage relies on the concept of
how Importing works in Python.

8. How to create a Virtual Environment with a specific version?
Never remove the default Python from Linux(Ubuntu). Add Deadsneak PPA 
Repository to apt and perform 'sudo apt install python3.x'. Then install 
Virtualenv by 'sudo apt install virtualev'. Now call the Virtualenv using 
Python version that you want - 'python3.x -m virtualenv virtualenv_name'.
**It is Recommended that you always use the dafault Python version of your 
Linux operating system for a Bug free implementaion 

# Important Key Words

15. async, await, nonlocal - Doubt
7. in
8. and, or, not, is
