1. Why do we need to use Jupyter Notebook?
	The jupyter Notebook allows us to execute codes cell by cell and see the 
	output of each cell below it and eventually become a notebook that 
	separates the logic and the output of the analysis and be a good 
	story telling documentation at the end that is exaclty what a Machine 
	Learing Engineer want.

	In any cell write '%reset' and run it. All the variables in the Jupyter
	Environment will be flushed.
